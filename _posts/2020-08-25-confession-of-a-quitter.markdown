Last night, an article on Medium that enlightens me: [Read This If You Struggle With Finishing Things You Start](https://medium.com/@Jude.M/read-this-if-you-struggle-with-finishing-things-you-start-a0fdaa83aa6a). There are many things, projects that I used to feel enthusiastic to do, but never able to finish them. The main reason is I failed to keep commitment, and similar to the above author, I used excuses like: this is not worth doing anymore, or there is another thing that will be more valuable. 

Here are some things/goals/projects that I used to quitted (these are only somes that I still remember):

- Build habit to exercise regularly, get fit.
- Improve English, speak fluently. (This and the exercise habit have been there for many years but nothing has changed).
- Read books regularly.
- Write daily journal, write one blog post every week.
- Having my own app on AppStore:
  - Track investing portfolio.
  - A Watch app to detect and count Burpee workout.
  - Goals/Achievements tracker.
  - A Mac app that detects wrong sitting posture.
- Read business, financial news daily, keep learning investing.
- Help Junda to write DualGram on Huawei phones.
- Get driving license.

My three-month vacation has started, now I have plenty of time to do things that I always say I would do if I’m not so busy at work. In the last few days, I was even trying to find “something” that I should do on my vacation. Now it’s much more straightforward: finish the works that I’ve quit before, no matter if “it’s not worth anymore” or there are “better” ideas.
