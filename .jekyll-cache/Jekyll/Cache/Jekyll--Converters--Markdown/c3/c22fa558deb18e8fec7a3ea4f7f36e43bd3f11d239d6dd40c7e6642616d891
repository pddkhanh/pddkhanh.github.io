I"±<p>I feel so excited about the new year/decade. Itâ€™s kinda late for 2019 in review, because I just come back from the holiday in Korea. But anyway, just do it.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did-well">What I did well</h2>

<p>I did pretty good on making money:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I got a better job with a higher salary and managed to save around 55% monthly income.</li>
  <li>I started to research and invest in the stock market.</li>
  <li>Have another income stream from publishing iOS apps. This means a lot to me, although the amount is tiny (still not enough for one Kopi every day).</li>
</ul>

<p>Living healthier: eat fewer junk foods, go for exercise/activity with friends: walking, swimming, badminton).</p>

<p>Career: I joined Grab, working in much bigger scope than before, our team members are high-performance people, so I learned a lot in last 6 months (but to be honest, I was frightened and not sure if I can catch up). Now Iâ€™m not only doing iOS development tasks but also CI&amp;CD tasks, which I have chances to research deeper about tools / Apple frameworks like xcodebuild, XCTest,â€¦ to improve our productivity.</p>

<p>Have one more close friend in Singapore.</p>

<p>Had some wonderful trips to Japan, Maldives, Australia, Korea.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-be-improved">What can be improved</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Still spent too much money on gadgets, drinking and some other kinds of stuff that are not needed.</li>
  <li>Even though my investing produces good profit, it just because the stock market did well this year, not really from my knowledge. I still have a long way on the investing journey.</li>
  <li>I have a big problem with commitment, especially in learning English and exercise regularly. So my fitness and English speaking didnâ€™t improve much.</li>
  <li>For career, sometimes I still lack focus, then it causes me to work at night, which will harm my work-life balance and personal works.</li>
  <li>Had no trip with my mother.</li>
</ul>
