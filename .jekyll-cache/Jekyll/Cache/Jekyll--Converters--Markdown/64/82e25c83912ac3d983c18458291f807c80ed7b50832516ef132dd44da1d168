I"<p>Last night, an article on Medium that enlightens me: <a href="https://medium.com/@Jude.M/read-this-if-you-struggle-with-finishing-things-you-start-a0fdaa83aa6a">Read This If You Struggle With Finishing Things You Start</a>. There are many things, projects that I used to feel enthusiastic to do, but never able to finish them. The main reason is I failed to keep commitment, and similar to the above author, I used excuses like: this is not worth doing anymore, or there is another thing that will be more valuable.</p>
