I"„<p>Last night, an article on Medium that enlightens me: <a href="https://medium.com/@Jude.M/read-this-if-you-struggle-with-finishing-things-you-start-a0fdaa83aa6a">Read This If You Struggle With Finishing Things You Start</a>. There are many things, projects that I used to feel enthusiastic to do, but never able to finish them. The main reason is I failed to keep commitment, and similar to the above author, I used excuses like: this is not worth doing anymore, or there is another thing that will be more valuable.</p>

<p>Here are some things/goals/projects that I used to quitted (these are only somes that I still remember):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build habit to exercise regularly, get fit.</li>
  <li>Improve English, speak fluently. (This and the exercise habit have been there for many years but nothing has changed).</li>
  <li>Read books regularly.</li>
  <li>Write daily journal, write one blog post every week.</li>
  <li>Having my own app on AppStore:
    <ul>
      <li>Track investing portfolio.</li>
      <li>A Watch app to detect and count Burpee workout.</li>
      <li>Goals/Achievements tracker.</li>
      <li>A Mac app that detects wrong sitting posture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read business, financial news daily, keep learning investing.</li>
  <li>Help Junda to write DualGram on Huawei phones.</li>
  <li>Get driving license.</li>
</ul>

<p>My three-month vacation has started, now I have plenty of time to do things that I always say I would do if I‚Äôm not so busy at work. In the last few days, I was even trying to find ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that I should do on my vacation. Now it‚Äôs much more straightforward: finish the works that I‚Äôve quit before, no matter if ‚Äúit‚Äôs not worth anymore‚Äù or there are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ideas.</p>
